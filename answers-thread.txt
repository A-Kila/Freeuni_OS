It could be the case, that multiple threads are trying to add different key entries at the same location.
In that case, one thread will add an entry, but the other will overwrite it with its own.
This problem happens in put function. After a thread chooses a location for its key in loop on line 46, before
it changes the value of this location that position is still free for other threads to choose.
